- Description: The role of live electronics is to explain the subconscious of the femme.
             As soon as the first contradictions emerge, the noises and effects transform
             the two driving voices (represented by the cello and the accordion). In some cases,
             these transformations are subtile but, in other cases, they fill both the sonic
             and physical spaces. She can not control it. The only way to escape just keep
             walking in her own way.
